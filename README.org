#+TITLE: simple-datetime-overlay

* Description

~simple-datetime-overlay~ is an application that creates fullscreen overlays on specified monitors, displaying the current date and time. It is written using the Tauri framework, which is essentially a Rust alternative to Electron.

* Usage

To use simple-datetime-overlay, run the following command:

~simple-datetime-overlay [OPTIONS]~

where ~[OPTIONS]~ are any of the following optional flags:

- ~-o, --only-monitor <ONLY_MONITOR>~: Display the overlay on the specified monitor (e.g. ~--only-monitor 1~ displays on the first monitor)
- ~-a, --active-monitor~: Display the overlay on the monitor with the active, focused window. Note that this functionality currently only works on Linux systems running X11 that have ~xdotool~ installed.
- ~-h, --help~: Print help information
- ~-V, --version~: Print version information

The created overlays do not take focus and cannot be clicked so that they do not interfere with current windows.
Therefore, to close the created windows, send it a SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGHUP signal on Unix, or whatever the Ctrl+C signal equivalent is on non-Unix systems.

As an example of how you can set up simple-datetime-overlay on your own system, you could configure it to launch when you hold the Numpad 5 key and close when you release the key by running the command ~killall simple-datetime-overlay~; this is how I am using it on my system. Please note that this setup is not built into the application and is provided as inspiration for users to customize ~simple-datetime-overlay~ for their own purposes.

Here is a usage GIF showing simple-datetime-overlay in action:

Note that to make this GIF smaller, I reduced the framerate and the quality; the actual application is a lot smoother than what is shown.
